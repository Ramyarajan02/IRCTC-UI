# IRCTC-UI
The IRCTC app, serving millions of users daily, is a crucial platform for train ticket 
bookings, travel planning, and accessing ancillary services like tourism packages and 
catering. Despite its significance in simplifying railway operations and enhancing user 
convenience, the app has become a subject of widespread criticism due to its suboptimal 
user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. These issues cause user 
dissatisfaction, hinder accessibility, and lead to frequent errors during transactions. This 
project aims to redesign the app's interface to improve usability, accessibility, and overall 
satisfaction while adhering to modern HCI principles.
